HOW TO RUN:
Use Visual Studio to run the code


HOW IT WORKS:
Code asks user for two numbers
These two numbers must be >0
Program will complain otherwise

Question 1:
Uses recursion to find GCD
Finds a mod b = r
Will set b = a and r = b until the mod = 0
Will return b as the gcd then

Question 2:
Uses recursion to find s and t in sa+tb
Returns 3 values: GCD, s, and t
GCD is calculated using a%b
s = (t1 - b/a)*t1
t = s1

Question 3:
Takes the GCD od both numbers
Divides them with the GCD
Returns two values
